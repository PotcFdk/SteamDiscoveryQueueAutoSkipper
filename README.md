# Steam Discovery Queue Auto-Skipper
This userscript auto-advances when it detects that you are viewing a Steam Discovery Queue item.  
If your browser/setup supports it, it does this is a speedy way. If something goes wrong, it auto-retries and/or tries simulating a normal press on the "Next in Queue"-button. This should make sure that minor issues are automatically resolved.  
It also unlocks age-restricted apps (i.e. this script supports automating 18+ confirmations) and runs through multiple discovery queues to get the maximum number of cards per day.

## Why?
During the [Steam Summer Sale](http://steamcommunity.com/my/stickers/) you get trading cards for going through your queue up to three times a day.  
This script makes it easier to stay lazy.

## Sale
The script is optimized for the Steam Winter Sale 2016. Support for some of the functionality, including automation of multiple queues (two in this sale), along with other features, might not work with future sales. The script will be updated in such a case.
