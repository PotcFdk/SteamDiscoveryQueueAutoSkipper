# Steam Discovery Queue Auto-Skipper
This userscript auto-clicks the "Next in Queue" button when it detects that you are viewing a Steam Discovery Queue item.  
It also unlocks age-restricted apps (i.e. this script supports automating 18+ confirmations) and runs through multiple discovery queues to get the maximum number of cards per day.

## Why?
During the [Steam Summer Sale](http://store.steampowered.com/salefaq/) you get trading cards for going through your queue up to three times a day.  
This script makes it easier to stay lazy.

## Sale
The script is optimized for the Steam Summer Sale 2016. Support for some of the functionality, including automation of multiple queues (three in this sale), along with other features, might not work with future sales. The script will be updated in such a case.
